# vanilla-neural-net
<br>The neural network is a naive implementation using python 3 and numpy, python's linnear-algebra library.
<br>The neural network has one input layer with 3 neurons, one hidden layer with 3 neurons and one output layer with 1 neuron.
<br>The transfer function is sigmoid, even though it is outdated and should not be used in production

<br>This is the problem presented to the neural net. The neural net is not allowed access to the
last row, since that row is considered validation-data.
<br>After training, the neural net is presented with the last row of data.
